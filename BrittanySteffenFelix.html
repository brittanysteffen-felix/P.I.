        <h1>Brittany Steffen-Felix</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Brittany. My favorite culture that I am not native to is Native American culture.
            I love the various ways they show their appreciation for nature. There are many different tribes that all have different practices.
        Overall, I appreciate the core principles many of them share. Like their connection to the land, respect for elders, and their spiritual beliefs.
    
    I relate to and appreciate Wangari Maathai for starting the Green Belt Movement, and combining conservation, women's empowerment, and giving more access to nutritional food and clean water.
    I also relate to Marian Wright Edelman and her efforts to advocate for children in poverty through founding the Children's Defense Fund.

    I feel most creative when I have alone time.
